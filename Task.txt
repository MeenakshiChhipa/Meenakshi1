I have created an EC2 instance Access it from putty. Following commands are fired
-> ec2-user
-> sudo su
-> yum update -y
-> yum install docker -y
-> service docker status
-> service docker start
-> docker run -it --name container1 ubuntu /bin/bash
-> exit

-> mkdir phpdocker
-> In phpdocker directory i have created one PHP and Docker file using vi editor
-> index.php :

 <?php  
    echo ?Hello, Php?;  
 ?>  
-> Docker :

FROM php:7.0-apache  
COPY . /var/www/php  

-> After that i create the docker image

 docker build -t myimage . 

-> image is created or not we can check this using  command : docker images
-> After that run the image to create container

docker run -it --name mycontainer myimage /bin/bash

Now if we type our ec2 instance public ip in browser we can see the output

output : This is php file 

exit
