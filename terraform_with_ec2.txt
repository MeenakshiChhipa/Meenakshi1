Creating EC2 with Terraform :

I have created one instance on AWS EC2 and installed Terraform on that after that

This commands I have used

mkdir test

vi demo.tf  : I have write this content

provider "aws" {
  access_key = "Access Key"
  secret_key = "Secrey Key"
  region     = "us-east-1"
}
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

after that I have use the Terraform commands

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply


so the new EC2 instance is created using terraform.
